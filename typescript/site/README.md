# x402 Demo Site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that demonstrates the x402 payment protocol in action. The demo site includes a modern UI and a facilitator backend that handles payment verification and settlement.

## Overview

x402 is an open protocol for internet-native payments built around the HTTP 402 status code. This demo site showcases how to implement x402 in a real-world application, demonstrating:

- Payment-gated content access
- Real-time payment verification
- Payment settlement
- Integration with EVM-compatible blockchains

## Features

- **Payment Middleware**: Protect routes with a simple middleware configuration
- **Facilitator Backend**: Handle payment verification and settlement
- **Live Demo**: Try out the payment flow with a protected route

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A wallet with testnet USDC (for testing)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

2. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FACILITATOR_URL=your_facilitator_url
  RESOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
  NETWORK=sepolia
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
  ```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js application code
  - `/facilitator` - Payment facilitator API routes
  - `/protected` - Example protected route
- `/middleware.ts` - x402 payment middleware configuration

## How It Works

1. When a user tries to access a protected route, the middleware checks for a valid payment
2. If no payment is found, the server responds with HTTP 402
3. The client can then make a payment and retry the request
4. The facilitator backend verifies the payment and allows access
